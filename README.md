# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

# Create new project
```shell
npm init --yes
npm install --save-dev hardhat
npm install @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox

npx hardhat
```
# Run project
```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network testnet

run task
npx hardhat taskName
```
